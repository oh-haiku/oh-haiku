#Requirements and Analysis Document for OH-Haiku

#1 Introduction
##1.1 Purpose of application
The germ of this application is a tweet. The Swedish comedian Jesper RÃ¶nndahl (@jesperronndahl)
tweeted that he often thinks in chunks of three unrelated thoughts. He indicated that he would 
like to have an app that could tell him whether these three sentences constitute a haiku poem.

##1.2 General characteristics of application
This application is a simple and easy-to-use poem-checker. It can be used to verify that a piece of text is written according to Haiku-rules and tweet the text. The application is also an easy way to store the users poems. 
##1.3 Scope of application
Our scope is to let the user be able to write Haikus, save them and tweet them. The Japanese Haiku is written in one single vertical row and the only thing that is counted is the sound of the tokens which means that syllables are ignored. According to the Haiku criterias the Haiku should for example contain a word that refers to a time of year, not be sentimental, not contain too strong adjectives and merge nature observations with the conditions of life. It is nearly impossible to write an algorithm to check those things. Our algorithm focuses on the Western Haiku and therefore on counting syllables.
Only a Swedish language version is planned at the moment. Syllable counting is performed by counting groups of single or consequtive vowels. The algorithm does not handle compound words, i.e. vidareutveckla.

##1.4 Objectives and success criteria of the project
The purpose of this project is the release of the application. The success criteria is that version 1 of the application has been released as an apk package.
##1.5 Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations
 - Certified Haiku - A piece of text divided into three rows, with syllables distributed according to 5-7-5.
 - Non-valid Haiku - Any piece of text with a number of lines not equal to three, or syllables not distributed according to 5-7-5. 
 - Tweet - A post made on the microblogging website Twitter
 - Haiku Composition Activity - The initial view where the user is able to enter a piece of text divided in three rows. 

# 2 Proposed application
## 2.1 Overview
The app shall be able to tell if a piece of text is a haiku. 
The app will help the user to write a haiku by indicating where more syllables are needed
or where they need to be removed.
The user shall be able to tweet his or her haikus.
The app shall let the user save his or her tweets.

## 2.3 Non-functional requirements

###2.3.1 Usability

- The application shall notify the user at start up if a more recent version of the application exists
- A text that fails Haiku verification should not be tweetable using the application. (Twitter scenario 2.1)

###2.3.2 Reliability

- The Verify Haiku function should never fail! (Verify Haiku scenario 1.2)
- Saved Haikus should not be deletable by mistake 
- The Haiku should not disappear if access to Twitter or Internet is missing

###2.3.3 Performance

- Saving a Haiku should not take more than 10 ms (Save a Haiku scenario 3.1)
- Deleting a saved Haiku should not take more than 10 ms (Deleting a Haiku ?)
- Robust
- Resource light, according to Android's demands

###2.3.4 Scalability, Extensibility

- Logic calculating syllables shall be separated from the Haiku logic
- The interface should be designed in a way making it possible to implement other rule based poetry later
- The design should easily be changable so that the rule algorithm can be used in other applications

###2.3.5 Packaging and Installation
- Shall be packaged as a Android application and be released on Google Play
- Shall have a selling description on Google Play

###2.3.6 Accessibility
- Verifying if a text is a Haiku should not require Internet access (Verify Haiku scenario 1.2)
- Saving a Haiku/text should not require Internet access (Save Haiku scenario 3.1)

###2.3.8 Legal
- Shall use en suitable license. The MIT license will be used if no conflicts occur, for example from using external libraries. The project may become licensed under a GPL license if necessary

##2.4 Application models 
###2.4.1 Scenarios
In general the user is able to enter a piece of text, check if the text is written according to our Haiku-criterias and if it is, tweet it. The user can log in to Twitter with Twitter credentials and therefore the user doesn't need to go to Twitter to subscribe the Haiku. The user is also able to get help with writing a Haiku, and save and browse written Haikus. 
   
###2.4.2 Use case model Use cases priority
 
###2.4.3 Static model 
###2.4.4 Dynamic model
###2.4.5 User interface
We want to use an attractive UI that is independent of the screen density. The leadwords in the creating process is simplicity, straightness and accessibility. The user should get going quickly and it should be easy to navigate. If the user gets to the menu when starting the application it takes time to get started writing. The user may go to the menu the first time but after that it is essential to be able to write Haikus and tweet them quickly. 

The lotus flower is a persistent feature in the application and it should bring thoughts to Japan.

## 2.6 Possible future directions
In general the possible future directions should focus on developing the Haiku-algorithm.
First and foremost, the algorithm should be able to handle Swedish compound words.
The algorithm could also take artistic values into account, like the following:
 - It contains a word that refers to a time of year 
 - It is divided in two parts in order to surprise 
 - It is not sentimental
 - It merges nature observations with the conditions of life
 - It should be short-spoken and avoid repetition
 - It should not contain personal pronominals
 - It should avoid too strong adjectives
 
Adding additional languages should also be possible.

## 2.7 References
References on the Haiku algorithm:

 - [Svenska Haiku SÃ¤llskapet](http://www.haiku-shs.org/shs.htm)
 - [Wikipedias definition av en Haiku](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku)
 


#3 Architecture
The application is a standard Android application with a database. The database is used to store Haiku poems. The application has modules for counting syllables and checking whether an input string is a valid Haiku. The application adheres to the standard Android MVC pattern. All views have corresponding Activities. Activities communicate with each other using Android Activity Results. The application has modules for Twitter authentication and authorization.

#4 Design
Ready-made syllable counters will be considered. A possible alternative is to use an algorithm that is used in LaTeX. That algorithm is stated in a doctoral dissertation. Finished implementations are already released under the GPL-license. If we will choose that implementation we have to change our choice of license. 

The ORMLite library is used for database interaction. Activities that need to access the database extend the ORMLiteBaseActivity class.

In terms of the Twitter-integration we will consider existing libraries. Twitter4J is a possible alternative. The library manage authorization and authentification with Twitter through OAuth. The license is Apache, which should be compatible with MIT.
